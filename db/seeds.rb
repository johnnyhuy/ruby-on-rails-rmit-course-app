Many other areas of Computer Science require the ability to work with concepts from discrete structures. Discrete structures include topics such as set theory, logic, graph theory, and probability theory. The material in discrete structures is pervasive in the areas of data structures and algorithms but appears elsewhere in Computer Science as well.')
compTheory = Course.create(name: 'Computing Theory', user_id: 2, description: 'Computing Theory introduces you to foundational issues in computer science. The emphasis is on understanding and applying foundational concepts and techniques. You will learn and apply fundamental theories of computing to computing problems. Topics include the study of formal models of computation and computability properties, measuring time requirements for a computation approaches to difficult problems, the use of grammars to specify syntax rules.')
